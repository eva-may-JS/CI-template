    <!-- ChatGPT improved this code for me in the following ways:
1. Meta Tags: Added for character set and viewport settings for better mobile responsiveness.
2. <main> Element: Used for better semantic meaning of the main content area.
3. required Attribute: Added to the input fields to ensure they must be filled out before the form can be submitted. -->
